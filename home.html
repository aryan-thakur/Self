<p>Welcome to the (completely static) website of Aryan Thakur. I currently am a 3rd year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto
  and am specializing in entrepreneurship. My other interests include football (soccer), basketball, spending hours at the gym,
  creating short videos, and much more. You can find more professional details about me through my resume, that is available for download
  from my skills page. Other casual information, thoughts and interesting events can be found on the newsboard page. You can contact me down below.
  The quickest way will be to shoot me an Instagram DM.</p>
