    <h2> The Work I Did </h2>
    <p> Being in the Cyber Security branch of RBC, every team and individual aimed to improve the enterpriseâ€™s security with their products, services and projects.
        I worked on the Firewall Rule Accreditation Project, that aimed to clean up unused firewall rules in the RBC firewall policies, to basically tie up
        loose ends and therefore tighten security based on the Principle of Least Privelege. I recieved change requests, and edited the firewall rules of
        vendors such as Palo Alto and Check Point. Other times, I verified if the changes were made by properly by automation scripts.
      </p>
      <br>
    <br>
    <p> Another part of my work at the firm was Risk Assessment. The way this worked was fairly simple: a lot of data and metadata was collected for new rule requests
      from the rule requesters.
      Through automation scripts data was fetched from internal RBC data platforms about the risk and validity of this possible new rule. Using these results
       and analyzing the rule myself, through security training and research I made an informed decision on whether to accept this rule and create it in the firewalls or
      request for a re-submission.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The work I did at RBC showed me just how vast yet interesting the field of Cyber Security is. Being my first job experience as well, I learned a lot about
      the corporate structure, life and expectations. I gained invaluable techincal and non techncial knowledge and really felt welcome at the company even
      as a new, inexperienced joiner. The only recommendation I have for the firm is to give more substantial work to co-ops. That being said, the co-op work, at least for
       my team, was relatively light and although it gave me a good insight into the security world, I feel like I could have done more work, taken on more responsibility and learned more.
