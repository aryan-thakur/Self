    <h2> The Work I Did </h2>
    <p> Being in the Cyber Security branch of RBC, every team and individual aimed to improve the enterpriseâ€™s security with their products, services and projects.
        I worked on the Firewall Rule Accreditation Project, that aimed to clean up unused firewall rules in the RBC firewall policies, to basically tie up
        loose ends and therefore tighten security based on the Principle of Least Privelege. I recieved change requests, and edited the firewall rules of
        vendors such as Palo Alto and Check Point. Other times, I verified if the changes were made by properly by automation scripts.
      </p>
      <br>
    <br>
    <p> Another part of my work at the firm was Risk Assessment. The way this worked was fairly simple: a lot of data and metadata was collected for new rule requests
      from the rule requesters.
      Through automation scripts data was fetched from internal RBC data platforms about the risk and validity of this possible new rule. Using these results
       and analyzing the rule myself, through security training and research I made an informed decision on whether to accept this rule and create it in the firewalls or
      request for a re-submission.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The work I did at RBC showed me just how vast yet interesting the field of Cyber Security is. Being my first job experience as well, I learned a lot about
      the corporate structure, life and expectations. I gained invaluable techincal and non techncial knowledge and really felt welcome at the company even
      as a new, inexperienced joiner. The only recommendation I have for the firm is to give more substantial work to co-ops. That being said, the co-op work, at least for
       my team, was relatively light and although it gave me a good insight into the security world, I feel like I could have done more work, taken on more responsibility and learned more.

    <h2> The Work I Did </h2>
    <p> My first 4 months in the firm initially revolved around trainings: KPMG corporate compliance courses and Microsoft Azure courses. The Azure training was integral
      to the work that would soon follow. After my trainings concluded, around the second month of my term with the company, I was introduced to my 5-person team and told that
      I would be working on developing a new KPMG product. The product I was going to develop was an MSS SIEM (Managed Security Systems, Security Information & Event Management)
      and the main portion of this development would be dev-ops heavy on the Microsoft Azure Platform. I began work I had never previously done, I began provisioning Virtual Machines
      installing services, linking machines together, configuring and sending logs from firewalls to these machines and so on. There was a lot of interesting and crucial work and
      I had accessible help every step of the way, whenever I needed it. Towards the end of my term I was designated scripting work in Python, which is something I
      have always been familiar with and executed the scripting to perfection. Every task I complete had to be documented, and creating documentation files around tasks and code
      made up a great chunk of my term at KPMG as well. As of today I am still around my half-way mark into this co-op, the SIEM is not yet completely developed
      and am excited about the things that will follow.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Being a consultant at KPMG is an extremely dynamic position. Project requirements and skills are constantly changing, and one needs to keep up with the heavy demand.
      I can confidently say that this has been the best job experience I have had. Being recruited as an integral part of a team in charge of developing a crucial KPMG offering, that would
      be eventually sold to big clients, has been a pleasant surprsie to me. Being a co-op student feels no different that a full time employee and my work is valued and indeed, used
      appropriately as well. Even though at times the work is challenging, the readily avaialble assistance from my higher-ups has led this term to be a great learning experience as well.
      Once again, I have delved into a new technical world: Cyber Security through SIEM and Dev-Ops. The amalgamation of Software Development and Cyber Security has been something I had
      been actively searching for and being able to experience it during my university co-ops has definitely been nothing short of phenomenal.
